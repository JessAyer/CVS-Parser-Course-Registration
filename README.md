# CS-300-Course
<b>•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?</b>

This project was to show competency in building structures, sorting elements, and traversing through the structures to search for and output a single element or output the entire list in alphanumeric order. In this course we studied, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, and Binary Search trees, computed the runtimes for each and chose which structure we deemed the most appropriate for the project. We were given a list of courses with corresponding course numbers and the required prerequisites where applicable. 

<b>•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.</b>

Over this term we created individual projects for each type of data structure which I was able to recreate for the final project. It was important to understand each data structure and how they could be merged together. The project could have been built with a simple vector however, it would have had a poor runtime and excessive memory use. I chose to use a Binary Search Tree to store the courses paired with a vector to hold the data for the prerequisites. 

<b>•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?</b>

As someone who is fairly new to coding, I found this project to be challenging and put in many hours of trial and error. The biggest challenge for me was loading the courses and prerequisites into the data structures. I had to try a few different approaches and do a bit of research to adjust the program. At first, I was planning to store all of the data in the Binary Search Tree, however because not all elements have prerequisites, I kept receiving error messages. Switching to storing the prerequisites into a separate vector allowed me to bypass the need for each line in the original file to contain the same number of elements, however it presented its own challenge as to how to separate the data and then combine it back together for the required output. 

<b>•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?</b>
  
  The project showed me how important it is to create code that can be easily reused. It was extremely helpful to be able to go back through previous projects to find the pieces needed for the final project. It also helped me gain better knowledge on how to use nodes which I previously failed to grasp. 
  
  <b>•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</b>
  
  With each project I feel my formatting improves. My ability to reuse base code or at least follow the in-line comments to edit and rebuild it for other projects has improved throughout this course. Using block comments to separate the different pieces of the code made it easy to search back through it to make edits where needed without having to search line by line each time I wanted to make a change.
